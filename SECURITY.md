## Security Practices

To ensure the security of Linly-Talker, the project follows these best practices:

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
  - Utilize tools like `pip-audit` and `safety` to scan for security issues in Python packages.

- **Code Reviews**:
  - All changes to the codebase must pass peer reviews to identify potential security concerns.

- **Vulnerability Scanning**:
  - Perform regular scans on dependencies and Docker images using tools like Trivy and Dependabot.

- **Secure APIs**:
  - Implement HTTPS for API communication to ensure data encryption.
  - Restrict API keys and sensitive data access through proper environment variable management.

- **Least Privilege Principle**:
  - Ensure that resources and services have the minimum permissions required to operate.

- **Community Awareness**:
  - Educate contributors and maintainers on secure coding practices and potential threats.
